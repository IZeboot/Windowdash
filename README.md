# Windowdash - Swift Doordash Clone
![Swift version](https://img.shields.io/badge/swift-5.0-orange.svg)
![Platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-iOS%20-lightgrey.svg)

Windowdash is an extremly high imitation swift clone of the most popular food delivery app Doordash. (Continually updating)

## Getting Started

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Mononster/Windowdash.git
$ cd Doordash/
$ open .
Open Doordash.xcworkspace
```

## Why

Doordash is my favourite and the most used app while I was doing an internship in the bay area. Their app's UI/UX is by far the best one I have seen that achives greatness with the simple and common design patterns.  

But sometimes I see buggy scrolling effects and lagging in the app (the app has improved a lot since last year tho). 
So I decide to write the app myself and see how they implemented this product (and maybe improve/fix these bugs), while achieving a pefect and smoothest interface.  


## How

1. Use Charles to intercept backend requests and use rewrite tool to turn all experiments on. Then picks experiments with my favourite and the most interesting UI/UX to implement.
2. IGListKit -> The greatest library to implement smoothest lists. [Push IGListKit to its limit!]
3. Use Sketch and AI to get colors, fonts and draw the app images.

[Coordinator](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/) + [VIP (Clean Swift Archtecture)](https://hackernoon.com/introducing-clean-swift-architecture-vip-770a639ad7bf) + MVVM

* ApplicationEnvironment to handle app's different environments, i.e. staging, localhost, production.
* ApplicationDependency to handle things that uses in the lifecyle of the app
* AppCoordinator to handle the top navigation logic of the app.
* ApplicationSettings to store client controlled feature flags.
* CoreData + Keychain to store user info.
* Alamofire + Moya for network layer.

## Implemented components

* Parallax scrolling -> See item detail page.
* Fixed point customized slider -> See rating at delivery page.
* Page scroll menu. -> See store detail page.
* IGListKit - Embeded section controllers -> See delivery page, entirely based on embeded controllers.
* Add Stripe Card -> See add payment page.
* Search with different states -> See search address page.
* MapKit, pin appear/selected animations. -> See pickup map page.

## Anything else I can do with this clone?

* Use existing models and make orders from command line.
* Experience doordash's features before they roll out to public.
* Remove the features you don't like and build your completely customized doordash experience.
* More and more...

## Fun Facts

I applied internship positions at Doordash twice,  unfortunately both of them got rejected within a day :(. This also drives me to write the clone app.

Pick up map is still an under testing feature. 

Doordash put their debug pannel under a experiment feature flag (??).
